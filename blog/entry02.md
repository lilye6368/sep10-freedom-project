<h6>THIS NEEDS TO INCLUDE WHAT I FOUND AND HOW I FOUND IT OK?</h6>


## Engineering Design Process

<h4>I am in the first step of learning in engineering design process (EDP).
My goal within this part is the find problems, fix them, and make a solution, or keep on learning new ones / for code too.</h4>

## Skills

Some skills that I’ve learned from working on this blog are **time management**, **how to google**, and **communication**. 

#### Time management

I have several commitments outside of school, such as picking up my brother from school every day, being on a swim team, and being in a gaming club two days a week. But my workload at school is becoming busier, so I needed to make more time for this project as well as my history class. So I decided to cut back from two days of gaming club per week to just one day per week. I think this change will help moving forward.

#### What I searched up to get to my final results

#### Communication

Communication was another important skill I have developed. Since I’m working on this project with another person, it’s important to collaborate and talk to one another. At first, we were doing our own searches and not sharing what we found. But finally we made a collaborative Google Doc where we could compile the links we found interesting as an efficient way to share what we found. We plan to check-in with each other at least once a week about the project, probably on Sunday afternoons.

## Next steps

I look forward to researching the existing innovations in visual arts!`
