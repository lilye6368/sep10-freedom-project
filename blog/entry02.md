## Engineering Design Process

I am currently in the first stage of the engineering design process, where the main goal is to define the problem. The problem that I hope to solve with my project is that **people are not informed about the world of technology in visual art**. The next stage is to research the problem and I plan to use not only articles and websites, but to also talk to my peers and those around me to discuss the issue and gain their input on the situation. 

## Skills

Some skills that I’ve learned from working on this blog are **time management**, **how to google**, and **communication**. 

#### Time management

I have several commitments outside of school, such as picking up my brother from school every day, being on a swim team, and being in a gaming club two days a week. But my workload at school is becoming busier, so I needed to make more time for this project as well as my history class. So I decided to cut back from two days of gaming club per week to just one day per week. I think this change will help moving forward.

#### What I searched up to get to my final results

#### Communication

Communication was another important skill I have developed. Since I’m working on this project with another person, it’s important to collaborate and talk to one another. At first, we were doing our own searches and not sharing what we found. But finally we made a collaborative Google Doc where we could compile the links we found interesting as an efficient way to share what we found. We plan to check-in with each other at least once a week about the project, probably on Sunday afternoons.

## Next steps

I look forward to researching the existing innovations in visual arts!`
