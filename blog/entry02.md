#### Communication

Communication was another important skill I have developed. Since I’m working on this project with another person, it’s important to collaborate and talk to one another. At first, we were doing our own searches and not sharing what we found. But finally we made a collaborative Google Doc where we could compile the links we found interesting as an efficient way to share what we found. We plan to check-in with each other at least once a week about the project, probably on Sunday afternoons.

## Next steps

I look forward to researching the existing innovations in visual arts!`
