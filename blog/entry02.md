## Engineering Design Process

I am in the first step of learning in the **Engineering Design Process (EDP)**. 

My goal within this part is the find problems, fixes, and make a solution, or keep on learning new ones / for code too.



## Skills

So, some skills I am learning or have already learned from this blog are...


* Beginner Code
* Searching for **Evidence**
* Finding **Correct Resolutions/Results** for my topic


---

## Sources

For **sources**, I especially choose or have chose ones that I know for a fact are true and not incorrect. I need to make sure of this so I know that the topic im speaking or talking about is fully true.


## So, what did I do to get my results, answers, and evidence?

You might be asking how I got my evidence/results and if they are even correct information.

Well, it is pretty **straightforward**

You can either search up to find your information, or you can search up **trusted sources**

I already searched up some sources of **Health and Wellness** for you to check out!
