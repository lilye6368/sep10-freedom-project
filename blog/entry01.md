One thing I learned was href which is a way to store link (or images) to the `html-make-something project`. Some other things i've learned about was how to put sentences on different places of the project. This helped me so it looks neater and not all together in a small spot. A few other things that I also learned was how to put links on my page, yet im still trying to perfect it since I did it wrong the first try in my page. `html-make-something project` That's mostly what i've learned for now. But lastly, im trying to learn more basic stuff that I can use in the future for my next assignments that need time and precision.
