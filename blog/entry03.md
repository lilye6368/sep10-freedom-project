<h3>How did I brainstorm ideas for Part B?</h3>
Here is a list of ways I have brainstormed and thought about what I was going to write in my <b>Part B</b> section in my last page:

---
<li>Thought about AI: How much it has progressed in the last few years, it is worthy to be helpful in the future or future technology going back to my topic</li>
<li>Searched up how AI could help in healthcare</li>
<li>Thought of different solutions and what hasn't already been used for medical technology</li>
<li>How those inventions/new ideas could be helpful in medical</li>
<li>The purpose of the idea, how much could it help in medical?</li>
<li>Which types of people are using it and what are they using it for, what does it help them with?</li>
