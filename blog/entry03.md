<h3>How did I brainstorm ideas for Part B?</h3>
Here is a list of ways I have brainstormed and thought about what I was going to write in my <b>Part B</b> section in my last page:

---
<li>Thought about AI: How much it has progressed in the last few years, it is worthy to be helpful in the future or future technology going back to my topic</li>
<li>Searched up how AI could help in healthcare</li>
<li>Thought of different solutions and what hasn't already been used for medical technology</li>
<li>How those inventions/new ideas could be helpful in medical</li>
<li>The purpose of the idea, how much could it help in medical?</li>
<li>Which types of people are using it and what are they using it for, what does it help them with?</li>

## Enginnering Design Process 
For this stage of the <b>Enginnering Design Process,</b> I am testing out code <b>(HTML, CSS)</b> and I will be learning how to implement it. I currently try to find problems in my code, and try to fix it, as well as showing why it's important to solve and learn from my mistakes. For my next stage of <b>EDP,</b> I will be trying a little more complex or more normal coding ideas, like detailing the design more if I can, and testing more implementations or computational parts of my webpages and/or projects.

## Skills: 

For this section, I have learned a few skills and not just to use inside of school for my assignments, but as well as for outside the school too. 2 skills I have learned so far since the previous entry is how to make my pages more professional. Some ways I did this was by adding more bulleted points, making my points clear, and explaining what I'm talking about. This is so the person reading knows exactly what my point is and the reasons for it. One more skill i've learned
